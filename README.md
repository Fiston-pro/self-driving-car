# Self Driving Car
We use ESP32-cam and OpenCv to drive a car through a lane

## GET STARTED

- Start by connecting the esp32 cam correctly with FTDI programmer (Read for more: [here](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/program-upload-code-esp32-cam/))
- Upload the code


##### Incase you get errors while uploading
- Make sure you unplug other stuff on esp32Cam
- make a loop on a FTDI programmer btn middle pin and 5v(depending on where you connect esp32 cam, for now we connect on 5V)
- Make a loop on ESP32 cam btn IO0 and Gnd
- When you connect from FTDI to ESP32 use 5v and Gnd which are close together
